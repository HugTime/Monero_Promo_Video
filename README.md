# Monero Promotional Video

Adobe AfterEffects project file is in monero_promo.aep

Adobe Illustrator vectors are in Illustrator_Vectors

Subtitles are in MoneroSubs.SRT

Voiceover audio file is in Monero_Promo_VoiceOver.128.mp3

The voiceover is currently a 128k mp3, which is definitely not ideal. We are currently looking to get a higher quality version of the MP3 from the creator, but are also open to redoing it, if you think you can do better.

The custom music by Savandra is in monero_promo_music.wav
